# to create a class, use the ksyword class:

# class
class MyClass:
    x = 5


# object
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)


# the __init__() function:
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age


p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

# object methods:


class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def myfunc(self):
        print("Hello my name is " + self.name)


p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()

# the self parameter:
# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

# It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:


class Person:
    def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
        mysillyobject.name = name
        mysillyobject.age = age

    def myfunc(abc):
        print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)


p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()


# delete object properties and delete object:
del p1.name
del p1

# the pass statement:


class Person:
    pass
